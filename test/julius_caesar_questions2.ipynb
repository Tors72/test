    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "This depicts Caesar's Public persona of humility as well as his fatal flaw of ignoring private warnings. He places state matters before personal concerns which demonstrates his commitment to image and governance. However, his ignorance and refusal to listen tragically costs him his life."

    "Brutus observes Popilius Lena smiling and notices that Caesar's expression remains unchanged. He concludes that Popilius was not referring to the conspiracy and therefore reassures Cassius that their secret is still safe."

    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "Cassius panics because Popilius's words imply that he may know about the conspiracy. Cassius fears their plan has been discovered and worries that Caesar will be warned, which would lead to the failure of the conspiracy."

    "**Q: How does Caesar react to Metellus Cimber's pleading?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "Caesar is offended by Metellus Cimber's flattery. He bluntly told him that his bowing and humble salutations might persuade ordinary people and turn what is ordained by the law as liable to change like the rules made by children. However, Caesar declares that he is not like ordinary men and will not be influenced by such behavior. He scorns him for believing that Caesar bears such false spirit which can be persuaded by his sweet words."

    "**Answer**:\n",
    "Caesar states that if he were an ordinary person, he would be swayed by pleas and prayers. However, he asserts that he does not appreciate such flattery. He believes that he is constant, firm and unshakable in his decisions, unlike ordinary people who are easily persuaded by pleading. He quotes the constancy of the northern star to emphasize his point. He remarks that the skies are full of stars. The fire in all of them makes them shine, but there was only one star among them that was constant and remained fixed in its position."

    "**Q: How does Caesar describe his own constancy, and what comparison does he make to emphasize his unshakeable nature?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "Caesar compares the stars in the sky to the men in the world. Just as the sky is full of innumerable stars, the world is filled with people. Among those stars, only one remains fixed and unchanging - the Northern Star. Similarly, among men who are 'flesh, blood' and are easily influenced, Caesar claims that he alone is unwavering, firm and constant in its decision, just like how the northern star remains constant in its position in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, he compares his resolve to Mount Olympus, a mountain in Greece said to be the abode of the Gods, as it was an impossible task to lift it. Caesar says that his resolve is as unshakable as Mount Olympus."

    "**Q: Overall analysis of Caesar's characterization with reference to his speech.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "In Act 3, Scene 1 of Julius Caesar, Caesar is portrayed as proud, arrogant, self-centered, boastful and pompous. His speech, where he compares himself to the Northern Star, reveals his belief in his own superiority over others. Caesar claims that while the world is filled with countless people, he alone is firm, constant, and unchanging, like the northern star that remains fixed in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "His refusal to repeal Publius Cimber's banishment despite the conspirators' pleas reflects his stubbornness and unyielding nature. He dismisses their flattery and humble requests as childish games meant to sway ordinary men, but insists that he is above such influence. This reveals his belief in his infallibility(inability to be wrong) and his view of himself as a supreme, unassailable authority.\n"
