which could ruin everything and lead to their arrest or death.

Answer:
Cassius says that if their conspiracy has been uncovered,
he will kill himself rather than be captured or live with the shame of failure.

4️⃣ How does Caesar compare the world of men to the firmanent?

Answer:
Caesar says that if he were like ordinary people, he would be persuaded by pleading and prayers -
but he claims he isn't like them and his resolve cannot be moved.
He believes that he is constant, firm and unshakable in his decisions
unlike ordinary people who are persuaded by pleading.
He quotes the constancy of the northern star to emphasize his point.
He remarks that the skies are full of stars.
The fire in all of them makes them shine,
but there was only one star among them which was constant and stayed in its place no matter what.

5️⃣ How does Caesar describe his own constancy,
and what comparison does he make to emphasize his unshakeable nature?

Answer:
Caesar compares the stars in the skies to the men in the world.
Just as the sky is full of innumerable stars, the world is filled with people.
Among those stars, only one remains fixed and unchanging - the Northern Star.
Similarly, among men who are ' flesh , blood ' and are easily influenced ,
Caesar claims that he alone is unshakable, firm and constant in its decision,
just like how the northern star remains constant in its position in the sky.

+ Another example cited in this respect was of Mount Olympus as it was an impossible task to lift it.
Caesar says that his resolve is as unshakable as Mount Olympus
